# Day 17 – Method Overriding

## What I learned today:

Today I learned about method overriding in Java.

---

## 🔹 What is method overriding?
Method overriding allows a child class
to provide its own implementation of a parent method.

---

## 🔹 Why method overriding is needed?
It allows different behavior for different child classes.
It helps model real-world scenarios.

---

## 🔹 Runtime polymorphism
Method call is decided at runtime
based on the object type.

---

## 🧠 Real Life Example
Employee → Manager salary  
Animal → Dog sound

## ✔ Summary
Today I understood how method overriding works.
I learned how runtime polymorphism happens in Java.
