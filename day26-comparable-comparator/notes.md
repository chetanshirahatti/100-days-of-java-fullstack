# Day 26 – Comparable vs Comparator Deep

## What I learned today:

Sorting custom objects requires comparison logic.

---

## 🔹 Comparable
Defines natural order inside class.
Uses compareTo().

---

## 🔹 Comparator
Defines custom order outside class.
Uses compare().

---

## 🔹 Internal working
Collections.sort() uses comparison methods to arrange data.

---

## 🧠 Real Life Example
Default personality vs external judge.

---

## ✔ Summary
Today I understood how Java sorting works deeply.
