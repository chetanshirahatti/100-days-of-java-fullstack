## What I learned today:

Today I learned about abstraction in Java.

## 🔹 What is abstraction?
Abstraction means hiding internal logic
and showing only necessary details.

---

## 🔹 Abstract class
- Can have abstract and normal methods
- Cannot create object
- Child must implement abstract methods

---

## 🔹 Interface
- Used for full abstraction
- Supports multiple inheritance
- Used heavily in real projects

## 🧠 Real Life Example
Car controls
ATM machine
Mobile apps

## ✔ Summary
Today I completed all OOP concepts.
I now understand abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces.
