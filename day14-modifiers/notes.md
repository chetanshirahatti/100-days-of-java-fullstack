## What I learned today:

Today I learned about modifiers in Java.

## 🔹 What are modifiers?
Modifiers control - access and behavior of variables, methods and classes.

---

## 🔹 Access Modifiers
- public → accessible everywhere
- private → accessible only inside class
- protected → accessible in same package and child class
- default → accessible in same package

---

## 🔹 Non-Access Modifiers
- static → belongs to class
- final → cannot be changed
- abstract → incomplete method or class

---

## 🧠 Real Life Example
Permissions in office:
Public → everyone  
Private → only me  
Protected → family  
Default → team

## ✔ Summary
Today I understood how Java controls access and behavior using modifiers.
