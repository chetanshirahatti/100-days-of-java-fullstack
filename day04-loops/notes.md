# Day 4 – Loops (for, while, do-while)

## What I learned today:

Today I learned about **loops in Java**.  
Loops are used when we want to repeat the same task multiple times.

---

## 🔹 Why loops are needed?
Instead of writing the same code again and again,
we use loops to save time and make code cleaner.

---

## 🔹 for loop
For loop is used when we know how many times the loop should run.

Example:
- Print numbers from 1 to 10
- Print table of a number

---

## 🔹 while loop
While loop is used when we do not know
how many times the loop will run.

The loop runs as long as the condition is true.

---

## 🔹 do-while loop
Do-while loop runs at least once
even if the condition is false.

This is useful when we want to execute something at least one time,
like showing a menu.

## 🧠 Real Life Examples
- Printing numbers
- ATM menu
- Game retry option
- Login attempts

## ✔ Summary
Today I understood how loops work in Java.
I can use for, while, and do-while loops to repeat tasks easily.
