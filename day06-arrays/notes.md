# Day 6 – Arrays

## What I learned today:

Today I learned about **arrays in Java**.  
Array is used when we want to store multiple values of the same type.

---

## 🔹 Why arrays are needed?
Without arrays, we need many variables.
Arrays help us store data in a clean and organized way.

---

## 🔹 Array basics
- Array index starts from 0
- Array size is fixed
- All values must be of same data type

Example:
Marks of students  
Prices of products  
Ages of people  

---

## 🔹 Array with loops
Loops are mostly used with arrays.
Loop helps us read all values one by one.

---

## 🔹 Array with methods
Arrays can be passed to methods.
This is very useful for calculations and business logic.

---

## 🧠 Real Life Examples
- Student marks list
- Product price list
- Monthly expenses
- Employee IDs

---

## ✔ Summary
Today I understood how arrays store multiple values.
I can use arrays with loops and methods confidently.
