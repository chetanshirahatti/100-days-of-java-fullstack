# Day 5 – Functions / Methods

## What I learned today:

Today I learned about **methods in Java**.  
Methods are used to divide a big problem into small parts.

---

## 🔹 What is a method?
A method is a block of code that performs a specific task.
We use methods to avoid writing the same code again and again.

---

## 🔹 Why methods are important?
- Code becomes reusable
- Program becomes easy to understand
- Easy to debug and maintain

---

## 🔹 Method with parameters
Parameters are values that we send to a method.
They allow the method to work with different inputs.

---

## 🔹 Method with return type
Some methods return a value after completing the work.
The returned value can be stored and used later.

---

## 🧠 Real Life Examples
- Calculator functions (add, subtract)
- Login validation
- Finding total marks
- Getting balance in ATM

---

## ✔ Summary
Today I understood how methods work in Java.
I can now create methods, pass parameters, and return values confidently.
