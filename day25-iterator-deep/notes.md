# Day 25 – Iterator Deep

## What I learned today:

Iterator helps traverse collections one by one.
It works for all collection types.

---

## 🔹 Key methods
hasNext()
next()
remove()

---

## 🔹 Important concept
For-each loop internally uses Iterator.

---

## 🔹 Fail-fast behaviour
If collection is modified during iteration,
Java throws ConcurrentModificationException.

---

## 🧠 Real Life Example
Library book browsing.

---

## ✔ Summary
Today I understood how collections are traversed internally using Iterator.
