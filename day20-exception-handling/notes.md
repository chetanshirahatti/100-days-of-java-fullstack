# Day 20 – Exception Handling

## What I learned today:

Today I learned how Java handles runtime errors.

---

## 🔹 What is an exception?
Exception is an unwanted problem that occurs during program execution.

---

## 🔹 Why exception handling is needed?
It prevents program crash.
It allows program to run safely.

---

## 🔹 try-catch-finally
- try → risky code
- catch → handle error
- finally → always runs

---

## 🔹 throw and throws
- throw → create exception manually
- throws → declare exception

---

## 🧠 Real Life Example
Handling road blocks while driving.

## ✔ Summary
Today I understood how to handle errors using exception handling.
This is very important for real applications.
