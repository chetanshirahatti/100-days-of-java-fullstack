# Day 16 – Inheritance

## What I learned today:

Today I learned about inheritance in Java.

---

## 🔹 What is inheritance?
Inheritance allows one class to use properties and methods of another class.

---

## 🔹 Why inheritance is needed?
It helps reuse code.
It avoids duplication.
It makes code easy to maintain.

---

## 🔹 IS-A relationship
If we can say “Dog is an Animal”,
then inheritance is correct.

---

## 🔹 Important rules
- private members are not inherited
- constructors are not inherited
- one class can extend only one class

---

## 🧠 Real Life Example
Parent → Child  
Employee → Manager  

---

## ✔ Summary
Today I understood how inheritance works.
I can now create parent and child classes using extends.
