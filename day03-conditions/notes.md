# Day 3 – Conditions (if, else, switch)

## What I learned today:

Today I learned about **conditions in Java**.  
Conditions are used when we want the program to make decisions.

---

## 🔹 What are Conditions?
Conditions help the program decide **what to do next** based on a value.

Example in real life:
- If it is raining → take umbrella
- Else → go normally

Same logic is used in Java.

---

## 🔹 if condition
The `if` block runs only when the condition is true.

Example:
If marks are greater than 60 → pass

---

## 🔹 else if condition
`else if` is checked when the first `if` condition is false.
We can have multiple `else if` blocks.

---

## 🔹 else condition
`else` runs when **none of the above conditions are true**.
It is like a final option.

---

## 🔹 switch statement
Switch is used when we have **fixed choices** like:
- days of week
- menu options
- numbers with specific meaning

Switch makes the code cleaner than many else-if statements.

---

## 🧠 Real Life Examples
- Marks system (Grade A, B, C)
- Day selection (Monday, Tuesday)
- Menu selection in ATM or restaurant

---

## ✔ Summary
Today I understood how Java programs make decisions using conditions.
I can now use if, else if, else, and switch statements confidently.

Next: Loops (for, while, do-while)
