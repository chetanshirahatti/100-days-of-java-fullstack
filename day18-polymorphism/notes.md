## What I learned today:

Today I learned about polymorphism in Java.

## 🔹 What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism means one thing behaving in many ways.

---

## 🔹 Types of polymorphism
1. Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading)
2. Runtime polymorphism (method overriding)

---

## 🔹 Why polymorphism is important?
It makes code flexible.
It reduces if-else conditions.
It is heavily used in real projects.

---

## 🧠 Real Life Example
Same person, different roles.
Same method, different behavior.

## ✔ Summary
Today I understood polymorphism completely.
I can now identify compile-time and runtime polymorphism.
